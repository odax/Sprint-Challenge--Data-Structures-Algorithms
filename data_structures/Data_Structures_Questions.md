Add your answers to the questions below.

1. What is the runtime complexity of your `depthFirstForEach` method?
o(n)

2. What is the space complexity of your `depthFirstForEach` function?
o(h)

3. What is the runtime complexity of your `breadthFirstForEach` method?
o(n)

4. What is the space complexity of your `breadthFirstForEach` method? 
o(w)

5. What is the runtime complexity of your `heapsort` function?
o(n*log(n))

6. What is the space complexity of the `heapsort` function? Recall that your implementation should return a new array with the sorted data. What would be the space complexity if your function instead altered the input array?

O(n*m)
Space complexity would be o(n)
